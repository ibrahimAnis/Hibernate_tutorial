Hibernate Projection :
---------------------
Projection is an interface in Hibernate; 
it is coming from org.hibernate.criterion package.
Projection can be applied to the Criteria query.
Projection is an Object-Oriented Representation of a query result set.

Hibernate Projection is used to read a partial entity from the database.

If we want to read more than one property from the database, 
then we have to add Projection objects to ProjectionList, 
and then we need to set ProjectionList object to Criteria.
